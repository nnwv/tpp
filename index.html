In July 1999, I presented the final chapter of World Spectators (2000) to a group of Getty fellows at the University of Rochester. This chapter marks the beginning of a major shift in my thought--of my turn away from "human construction" as the basis of what is, to  an emphasis on the world as the source of and referent for our perceptions, and  the affirmation of its colors, patterns and forms as the precondition for and beginning of care. It was already evident to me then that I was on the way--as Heidegger would say--to photography.22
	During  the lively discussion after my presentation, one of the other seminar participants asked me  “Where are all of the people?” I was dumbfounded, since I have often thought that there are too many people--or at least too many philosophers--in this chapter. It also ends with what I believed to be an appeal to "everyone." "If the significance which we find within [the earth's other inhabitants] were already latent within them," I write in the final paragraph of the book,  "we would be able to exhaust it with our perceptual and linguistic signifiers. However, they are pregnant not with meaning, but with beauty, and our capacity to signify beauty has no limits; it is born of a loss which can never be adequately named, and whose consequence is, quite simply, the human imperative to  engage in a ceaseless signification. It is a call to which none of us is adequate by ourselves; we are finite beings, beings who cannot help but come to an end. Only as a collectivity can we be equal to the demand not only to find beauty in all of the world's forms, but to sing forever and in a constantly new way the jubilant song of that beauty.”
	The smart-aleck in me wanted to respond, “Is there someone in particular you're looking for? Hannah Arendt is on pp. 2, 3, 24, 129-30, 148-9, and 155, Giorgio Agamben on p. 157, and Mieke Bal on pp. 160 and 170...” But the words stuck in my throat, because my questioner hadn't asked "where are the people?" He had asked, rather, "where are all of the people?"  This question is hugely important to me, as are those that lie unspoken within it. Who  are all of the people? Is it a club, to which you must be admitted? If so, what are the criteria, and can your membership be revoked? If it isn’t a club, what is the common denominator or unifying principle that makes it more than a random designation? 
	And how are we to construe the "where" with which this question opens? The only physical location large enough to accommodate all of the people is the world itself, and only a small part of it can be seen at any moment in time. And even if, through some miraculous intervention, I were suddenly equipped with "omnivision," I would have no way of determining whether everyone who was "supposed" to be there was in fact present, both physically and psychically. In what kind of place, then, should I be searching--conceptual, psychic, ontological, or perhaps even aesthetic? And is this place anchored to the earth, or is it strictly virtual? 
	By the time I retired for the night, I thought that I had identified the problem to which my questioner had alerted me.  He asked me where all of the people were, I told myself, because the word with which I had imagined myself to be referring to them--"collectivity"—has a very different meaning. A collectivity is a select group, whose participation is voluntary and provisional, and as easy to disassemble as it is to assemble. "All of the people," on the other hand, overrides all social distinctions, and  includes us whether or not we—or others----want us to be included. It means,  quite simply, "every human being.” But I could not think of a single domain within which the last three words have ever had any social traction, only instance after instance where they have not.
And this is hardly surprising, because the distinction between the human and the non-human is not only the first step in the winnowing process that leads to the radically diminished and affectively atrophied being that we call an “individual,” but also—given the vastness of the “sum” from which we attempt to  “subtract” ourselves—the most  draconian. I borrow this mathematical metaphor from Rilke, who uses it both to convey the enormity of what we try to leave behind and to urge us to count ourselves back in. “To all that has run its course, and to the vast unsayable/ numbers of beings abounding in Nature/,” he writes in Sonnets to Orpheus. “Add yourself gladly, and cancel the cost.”
But  even if were possible to be singular, in both senses of the word, all that would be needed to call this singularity into question and to initiate the process that begins with the repudiation of others, and ends in self-mutilation, would be the appearance  in one of the excluded terms of a quality or attribute that had previously been associated solely with its exceptional counterpart. There can be no mind in the body, no intelligence in the natural world,  and no intentionality in a mechanically-produced object. And it was here, I finally realized, that my capacity to think outside the confines of modern metaphysics had reached its limits. When I wrote that  the world's "creatures and things...are pregnant not with meaning but with beauty, but "that "our capacity to signify beauty has no limits," I reinstated the most foundational of these exclusionary exceptions. I restored "mind" to its lofty position as the sole source of intelligence, and man to his exalted position as the only being with a mind, thereby relegating the rest of the physical world to a mute,  albeit beautiful, materiality. 
	But why?, I asked myself.  What was it about the idea of a objective intelligence that made me duck for cover? and what on earth did this intelligence have to do with the question that I was asked on that long-ago summer day?

 I felt as if I was already "on the way to photography" while writing World Spectators because  Talbot's description of his calotypes closely resembles the encounter  at the center of my book--the one I call "appearance." In both cases, an image is "given off" by a body and is traced on  a receptive surface,  with the pencil of light.  In my account, this receptive surface is the psyche, but in Talbot's it is a photographic plate. Since the psyche is "inside," and a photographic plate "outside," the psyche invisible, and  a photographic plate visible, and the psyche "subjective," and a photographic plate  "objective," we would normally think of them as opposites. This manifestation in an object of something that I had reserved for the subject suggested that  photography might be an ideal vehicle  for exploring the “intelligence”  that I foreclose in the last paragraph of World Spectators, and what this has to do with the “all » in « all of the people. »
But I didn’t know where to look. Photography  is a very big  and amorphous « thing, » no matter how you define it, and I had neither  road signs nor internal directives.  Every path I took  soon trailed off, and  when I tried to proceed without one, I was soon lost. And this disorientation was not limited to my waking hours. The word WHERE would sometimes appear in giant letters on my mental billboard as I was falling asleep, like a word from  an Ed Ruscha painting. And  if I altered my sleeping position,  so as to escape from this unwelcome hallucination, « WHERE » disappeared, but an unnerving  series of questions took its place, uttered in the voice of Nietzsche’s madman. “But how did we do this?...Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing?”
 The question “what were we doing » when we “unchained this earth from its sun » is a reference to the primary metaphor through which classical metaphysics conceptualized space, and the answer that it would have given to the question « where are all of the people » : the Great Chain of Being. It is based on the assumption there are two worlds, one of which is both spatially and ontologically "above" the other and is the unchanging original, and the other of which is spatially and ontologically « below », and the corruptible or already corrupted copy.  Everything also comes from and refers back to its creator, and exists for only one purpose: to honor the one who made it.  And there was a place set « apart » for those who didn’t  conform to this highly restrictive mandate. No wonder Nietzsche opted instead for  infinite nothingness.
    Since  I was no more willing that he  to return to my pre-assigned position on  the Great Chain of Being, I thought for a while that I, too, had perhaps « burned » the land, and set sail on a limitless sea. Eventually, though, I realized that I was on a different « mission. » Nietzsche wanted to kill god so that he could be god. I wanted to get rid of everything to which we appeal in  order to set us apart from others--to eliminate the notion of an « outside, » both in its exceptional and its exclusionary forms.   My project  was to find a way of conceptualizing our « togetherness » that admitted of no exceptions. And I would never burn the land in order to achieve this goal, since the only « togetherness » that has ever interested  me is a terrestrial one.
But since I cannot read Nietzsche without experiencing all over again the thrill of his revolt, I know that I am connected to him in precisely the way Lou Andreas Salomé was : through « memories or half-conscious feelings of the most childlike sort, » that arise from « the most personal and indestructible part of my childhood. » And he was linked through her  to  a loosely-affiliated  group of other writers with whom I, too, feel a deep kinship: Proust, Freud,  Rilke, Benjamin, as well as Salomé herself.  These writers reminded me that the « all » for which I was searching was the opposite of the one to which the self lays claim—an « inside » for which there is no corresponding « outside. »
They also helped me theorize this « all » in literary rather than photographic terms—or so I imagined as I began writing  Flesh of My Flesh, the work that grew out of this train-of-thought. Now, at last, I said to myself as I typed the first words, I  know what I am doing. But the argument that I found myself mounting demonstrated the absurdity of this assumption. "[Instead] of a self- contained volume, authored by us, » I write there,  « our history is only one chapter in an enormous and ever expanding book whose overall meaning and shape we cannot even begin to grasp, let alone determine. But this does not mean that there is another kind of author; no one stands outside the Book of Life to whom it could be imputed. This volume is written from inside, through the analogies we acknowledge and those we refuse. Its production is also a collective process, in which 'everyone participates and everyone is implicated. »
But although  photography wasn’t on the book’s guest list, it  came early and stayed late; in fact, it « behaved » as if it had always been there.  Rilke and Proust describe their writing practices in terms that recall  the pencil of nature, Freud relies heavily upon concepts drawn from early photography in his account of perception, and there is at least one photographic metaphor in every important essay that  Benjamin ever wrote. Literal pictures also kept bursting into the book—both my own, and the one I was writing about. The first to arrive--four paintings by Paula Modersohn-Becker and Terrence Malick's 1998 film, The Thin Red Line--were "medium specific," but then came photographs that developed into paintings, and paintings that developed into photographs.
These hybrid images expanded into compendia that dramatically altered the ways in which I think about both photography and painting: the five-part video installation through which James Coleman "intervened" in the Louvre's 2002 exhibition of Leonardo's drawings and notebooks, and the vast constellation of photographs, photo-paintings and abstract pictures through which Gerhard Richter "claimed" what was already "his." It was also through repeated  visits to a retrospective of Richter’s work  that I was able to elaborate what is for me, at least, my richest accounts both of analogy and of  the Book of Life,  and while standing before a series of implicitly-photographic pictures hanging on the walls of a public museum that I learned how to read it. What ontological imperative and/or prerogative was photography asserting when it kept demanding a place at the table, I wondered, and what was the impetus behind this demand? It was time to take a look.

I have been looking for a long time now—so long, in fact, that the single volume  that I had expected to write has grown into a trilogy.  In the first volume of this study, The Miracle of AnaIogy, or The History of Photography, Part I (2015) I argue that photography is neither a nineteenth century nor a human invention and that it will not end until we do. Its lifespan mirrors our own because it is the world’s primary way of revealing itself to us. Through the inverted and laterally reversed images that appeared inside the pinhole camera, the world showed us that it exists, and by giving us likenesses of its forms, drawn with the light emanating from the forms themselves, it demonstrated that analogy is the mode of its—and so of our own—existence.¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬
[explain that analogy is a concept that you introduce in Flesh of My Flesh, and carry further in Miracle. I do so, however, in very different ways. In “Photography by Other Means,”  I theorize it primarily through Benjamin’s theory of history, and I” n Miracle primarily through Heidegger’s account of the “highest form of poesis.” Although B and H would not even want to find themselves in the same sentence, there are striking similarities between the two—but H’s is weighted much more toward the ontological, and B’s toward the social. Hidden in a one and a half page review of Blossfeldt’s ‘s first book, with the unlikely title “News About Flowers,” is the concept the missing link. Benjamin calls it an “image-geiser.” This  review written in 1928, a year before “The Image of Proust,” and then come the following: Paris Diary, 1930; Little History, 1931; Left-Wing Melancholy, 1931; Berlin Chronicle, 1932; author as producer, 1934. assumes in photography is strikingly similar to the one Heidegger associates with  the “highest form of poesis,” and to which he imputes  a “saving power.” It begins in the final 

Not only is this concept unthinkable without the madeleine episode chapter of the book, but proust defines analogy as having an inside/outside structure, like the camera obscura, but also the analogies that Benjamin lists when talking about Blossfelt, and blossfeldt’s photographs also burtst out of the archive in which Blossfeldt seeks to confine them into  to have a By « analogy, » I mean a relationship of greater or lesser similarity, and a corresponding degree of difference, between two or more terms. These links, which are radically  democratizing, are unbreakable, because they have been forged at the level of Being. Consequently, although we may live in utter disregard of them, we cannot abolish them. But most of us to not want to be  connected to each other by unbreakable links, that are not of our choosing. We want, in fact, the opposite : to be unique, self creating, answerable to no one,and nd ensconced in a place that is exclusively our « own,» with privileges that no one else enjoys. We are therefore constantly searching for ways of invalidating these analogies.
 Many of the analogies in the Book of Life  are “local”; they create couples, or groups. Others cohere into much larger networks. But there are some that run like a thread through all the pages,  stitching  each life into a chapter, and all of the chapters into what Salomé calls an « unfathomable totality. »   My primary example of such an analogy in Flesh is mortality, to which every living being is subject, but which each of us approaches in a slightly different way,  and which ultimately has less to do with dying than with living. I still believe in the importance of that…..[elaborate]
 But few people are willing to live “toward” death, as  Heidegger puts it, and even those who are often experience their emplacement within the “Altogether” in a very solitary way. Rilke is a case in point. He wrote the lines I quoted a few pages ago while living alone in a remote castle in Switzerland. After visiting him there in 19XX, Paul Valery observed. « In [his] house, my imagination could not but listen to the unending monologue of a mind entirely alone, undistracted from itself and from the feeling of its own uniqueness.» (Flesh 37) Consequently, although I would not say, as Heidegger does, that mortality is individuating, I do think that its efficacy within the social domain is extremely limited.
